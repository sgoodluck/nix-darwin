# Capture Screenshot

I'll capture a screenshot and analyze it for UI/UX improvements, accessibility issues, and potential bugs.

```bash
screenshot-capture
```

Now let me analyze the captured screenshot:

1. **Visual Design & Layout**
   - Overall aesthetic and consistency
   - Spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
   - Color usage and contrast

2. **User Experience**
   - Clarity of interface elements
   - Intuitiveness of navigation
   - Potential user friction points

3. **Accessibility**
   - Text readability and contrast ratios
   - Interactive element sizing
   - Screen reader considerations

4. **Technical Issues**
   - Rendering problems or visual bugs
   - Responsive design issues
   - Performance indicators

5. **Suggested Improvements**
   - Quick wins for better usability
   - Design enhancements
   - Accessibility fixes

I'll provide specific, actionable feedback based on what I observe in the screenshot.
