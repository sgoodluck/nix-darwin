# v1.0 Milestone Audit

**Milestone:** v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Auditor:** Claude (gsd-milestone-auditor)
**Status:** PASSED

## Summary

All 19 v1 requirements are covered by configuration-layer evidence and mapped to their phases. All 3 phases are complete with no configuration gaps or anti-patterns. All plugin files are correctly wired into lazy.nvim's auto-scan. No conflicting keymaps were found across phases. Runtime behaviors are categorized as `human_needed` by all three VERIFICATION reports — consistent with the project's static analysis limits — and the SUMMARY files document user approval of all runtime checks at plan checkpoints.

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Status | Verification Score | Gaps | Anti-Patterns |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|------|---------------|
| 01-foundation | 3/3 complete | COMPLETE | 7/8 must-haves (1 runtime) | None | None |
| 02-lsp-completion | 2/2 complete | COMPLETE | 7/7 automated | None | None |
| 03-editor-experience | 2/2 complete | COMPLETE | 4/4 automated | None | None |

Phase 3 plans 03-01-PLAN and 03-02-PLAN are shown as unchecked in ROADMAP.md, but VERIFICATION and SUMMARY files confirm completion dated 2026-02-26. The ROADMAP.md checkbox state is a stale documentation artifact, not a functional gap.

---

## Integration Verification

### lazy.nvim Auto-Scan

`init.lua:23` uses `require("lazy").setup("plugins", ...)` string form, which auto-scans `dotfiles/nvim/lua/plugins/`. The following plugin files are present and picked up automatically:

- `colorscheme.lua` (Phase 1)
- `treesitter.lua` (Phase 1)
- `lsp.lua` (Phase 2)
- `completion.lua` (Phase 2)
- `formatting.lua` (Phase 2)
- `fzf-lua.lua` (Phase 3)
- `gitsigns.lua` (Phase 3)
- `neo-tree.lua` (Phase 3)

No manual require() calls needed. No orphaned files. No plugin spec exists outside this directory.

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| Integration Point | From | To | Evidence |
|------------------|------|----|----------|
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | `init.lua` lazy bootstrap | `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` auto-scanned | WIRED — lazy.setup("plugins") picks up lsp.lua |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | Nix packages.nix | LSP binary PATH | WIRED — gopls, lua-language-server, nixd, rust-analyzer, ccls declared in Phase 1; pyright/stylua/rustfmt added in Phase 2 |
| Phase 2 internal | `lsp.lua` | `completion.lua` | WIRED — `require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities()` at lsp.lua:9 |
| Phase 2 internal | `lsp.lua` | `formatting.lua` | WIRED — `require("conform").format()` called from `<leader>lf` LspAttach keymap |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | lazy.nvim plugin dir | fzf-lua/gitsigns/neo-tree | WIRED — all three files present in lua/plugins/, auto-scanned |
| Phase 3 internal | `neo-tree.lua` | lazy-load init | WIRED — `init` BufEnter autocmd with `once=true` and `vim.uv.fs_stat` check |

### Keymap Conflict Check

All keymaps audited across `lua/config/keymaps.lua` and plugin specs:

| Keymap | Owner | Phase | Conflict |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| `<leader>w/q/h` | keymaps.lua | 1 | None |
| `<C-h/j/k/l>` | keymaps.lua | 1 | None |
| `gd, gr, K` | lsp.lua (LspAttach, buffer-local) | 2 | None — buffer-local, only active with LSP |
| `<leader>la/lr/lf/ld/lD` | lsp.lua (LspAttach, buffer-local) | 2 | None — buffer-local |
| `<leader>ff/fg/fb/fc` | fzf-lua.lua | 3 | None |
| `]h / [h` | gitsigns.lua (on_attach, buffer-local) | 3 | None — buffer-local |
| `<leader>e` | neo-tree.lua | 3 | None |

No conflicts. LSP and gitsigns keymaps are buffer-local (set in on_attach/LspAttach), preventing global namespace pollution.

### init.lua Bootstrap Chain

```
init.lua (26 lines)
  ├── require("config.options")   → lua/config/options.lua   [vim.opt.* only]
  ├── require("config.keymaps")   → lua/config/keymaps.lua   [non-plugin keymaps]
  ├── require("config.autocmds")  → lua/config/autocmds.lua  [2 autocmds]
  └── require("lazy").setup("plugins", {...})
        └── auto-scans lua/plugins/
              ├── colorscheme.lua  [lazy=false, priority=1000]
              ├── treesitter.lua   [event=BufReadPre/BufNewFile]
              ├── lsp.lua          [event=BufReadPre]
              ├── completion.lua   [event=InsertEnter + LspAttach]
              ├── formatting.lua   [event=BufWritePre]
              ├── fzf-lua.lua      [keys trigger]
              ├── gitsigns.lua     [event=BufReadPre]
              └── neo-tree.lua     [keys trigger + init BufEnter]
```

Chain is complete. No broken requires. No missing bootstrap steps.

## Core Value Assessment

**Project core value:** "Fast, capable editing across all development languages with the fewest plugins possible — every plugin must earn its place."

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Fast | 8 plugins total. Colorscheme loads eager; all others lazy-load on event or key. Baseline 34.330ms startup documented. |
| Capable | Full LSP coverage for 7 languages. Completion, diagnostics, format-on-save, fuzzy finding, git signs, file tree. |
| Fewest plugins | 8 plugins covering all v1 requirements. No redundancy (fzf.vim/telescope/commander replaced by fzf-lua alone). |
| Nix integration | All LSP servers managed via Nix packages.nix, not Mason. darwin-rebuild propagates PATH. |

---

## Gaps

None. All v1 requirements have configuration-layer satisfaction evidence. No required artifacts are missing or stubbed.

---

## Tech Debt

None identified. No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments in any plugin file. No deprecated APIs (no `require('lspconfig')`, no `vim.loop` — `vim.uv` used correctly). No empty handlers.

One documented deviation: `colorscheme.lua` uses `vim.cmd("colorscheme modus_vivendi")` with `variant="tinted"` in setup() rather than the originally-planned `vim.cmd("colorscheme modus_vivendi_tinted")`. This is the correct implementation per the modus-themes.nvim API. Documented and resolved in Phase 1.

---

## Verdict

**v1.0 milestone: PASSED**

All 3 phases complete. All 19 requirements satisfied. Integration chain verified. No gaps. No tech debt. Runtime behaviors are confirmed via user-approved SUMMARY checkpoints; static analysis cannot replace a live Neovim session for visual/interactive verification, which is expected and acceptable.
